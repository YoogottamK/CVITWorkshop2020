    "In this exercise we will apply basic concepts of probability and statistics to help a robot localise itself. Robot localization is an important task for any mobile robot as it needs to know where in the world it is currently situated in.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think robot localization is a very easy problem as you can use GPS. But no! GPS has errors in localization upto a few metres which is very inaccurate for self driving cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the robot needs to use sensors to locate itself. And sensors are noisy! Even the motion of a robot is uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, let us assume that the world is a one dimensional world with $N$ grid cells. Each grid cell is colored either red or green which can be measured using a sensor located in the robot. However, the sensor measurements are noisy and hence we need to take a probabilitic approach to determine in which of these grid cells the robot is situated in at a given instant of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot can move either left or right in this **cyclic** world. This motion is uncertain as well prompting us again to take a probabilistic approach. For example you may instruct the robot to move $5$ cells. But it may move $4/6$ cells due to a wheel slip.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the robot is switched on, it is in a state of maximum confusion. It doesn't know where it is situated. We will model this state of maximum confusion as uniform distribution. \n",
    "In other words, the robot has equal belief of being present in any of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
